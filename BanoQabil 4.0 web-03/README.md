## ðŸ“š What Iâ€™m Learning

This course is helping me become a backend developer using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.
Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m learning:

* How to build backend servers using **Node.js**
* Creating REST APIs with **Express.js**
* Connecting and working with **MongoDB** databases
* User authentication using **JWT** and **bcrypt**
* Handling files, validations, and error responses
* Implementing secure and optimized backend systems
* Deploying backend applications to production

Iâ€™ll also complete a **final backend project** to put all these skills into practice.
